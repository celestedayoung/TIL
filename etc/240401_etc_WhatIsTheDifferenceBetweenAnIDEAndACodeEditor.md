# What is the difference between an IDE and a code editor?

## ✓ Trigger
When writing Java code these days, I use Intellij, and in the past, I used PyCharm for Python. However, I use VSCode for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. I recently learned that Intellij is an IDE, while VSCode is a code editor. I became curious about the differences betweent these two programs and looked them up.

## ✓ What is an IDE and a Code Editor?
### IDE(Integrated Development Environment)
#### Definition
> ***An IDE is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities for software development.***
- An IDE normally consists of at least a source-code editor, build automation tools, and a debugger.
- Some IDEs such as Intellij or Eclipse contain the necessary compiler, interpreter or both.
- 
#### Examples
IntelliJ, PyCharm, Eclipse...


#### Pros and Cons

### Code Editor
#### Definition
> ***A code editor is a text editor program designed specifically for editing source code of computer programs.***
- It is a more advanced version of a text editor and both can be used for writing and editing source code.
- Modern code editors can offer you much more than that, for example, you can use them to debug code or work with Git.

#### Pros and Cons
##### Pros
- **Speed**: Code editors are generally lightweight and fast as they don't have a lot of features included on installation
- **Simplicity**: Code editors have fewer predefined features, so they tend to have a more strightforward and minimalistic UI.
- **Free to use**: Most code editors are open source and free to use.
- **Extensibility**: There are strong communities around these code editors, which means some good solution exist to extend the tools with new features.

##### Cons
- **Not pre-configured**: It can take a lot of time to customize code editors, find the right extensions, and make them all work together with each other correctly.
- **Extension fatigue**: 
- **Unexpected behavior**
