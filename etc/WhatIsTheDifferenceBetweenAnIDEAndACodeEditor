# What is the difference between an IDE and a code editor?

## ✓ Trigger
When writing Java code these days, I use Intellij, and in the past, I used PyCharm for Python. However, I use VSCode for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. I recently learned that Intellij is an IDE, while VSCode is a code editor. I became curious about the differences betweent these two programs and looked them up.
